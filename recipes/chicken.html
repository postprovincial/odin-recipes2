    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken mince or ground chicken stir fry is an Asian-inspired dish made with a very simple homemade sauce and lean chicken meat.</p>

    <p>And to make it more nutritious, I added some fresh vegetables such as yellow and spring onions, bell pepper, and zucchi.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound chicken breasts or thighs or store-bough ground chicken</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon olive oil.</li>
        <li>½ small onion.</li>
        <li>½ bell pepper.</li>
        <li>1 small zucchini.</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic.</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh ginger, diced or grated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken breast on a cutting board. Cut the chicken breast into ¼ inch slices. Cut each slice into thinner strips. Gather the strips and chop them finely. Repeat with the rest of the chicken. You can also mince it in a food processor.</li>
        <li>Cube onion, pepper and zucchini. Dice green onions. Grate or finally chop garlic and ginger.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat 1 Tablespoon of oil. Add diced onions, peppers and zucchini. Cook over medium-high heat for about 3-5 minutes, just until the vegetables start softening.</li>
        <li>Add minced chicken to the pan and fry it stirring often for 6-8 minutes or until the meat is fully cooked.
        </li>
        <li>Add garlic, ginger and the prepared sauce. Stir-fry for another minute or two until the garlic releases it's aroma.</li>
        <li>Garnish with sliced green onions. Serve hot over steamed white rice or noodles.</li>
    </ol>
